# Deep Learning-Powered Web App for Animal Identification (TF, Flask)
Developed a web application utilizing Deep Neural Networks (TensorFlow) to classify images and predict animal names using vgg19 pre-trained model.

Trained the model on a large dataset of labeled animal images, achieving high accuracy above 90% in animal identification.

Implemented Flask for a user-friendly web interface 1 for image upload and 2 for animal identification.

Animal image classifier - Deep Neural Network application created using tensorflow 

In this application We have used DNN and for user interface created web app using Flask. 
This application identifies different animals and predicts their names.
